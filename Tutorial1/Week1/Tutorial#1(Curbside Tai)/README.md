The present project develops a website, called "Curbside Thai," for a fictional food truck. There will be several pages to the website, including an About Us, Locations, Menu, Reviews, Catering options, and Contact Information, each with its own page, plus a Home page. The site is designed so that it's user-friendly and looks nice on many devices using basic HTML and CSS.

## Instructions for Running the Assingment 
The website has to be opened in any web browser by opening the file `index.html`. One can jump between different pages using the menu bar. I have changed the name of the file `ct_start.html` to `index.html` to avoid any copyright issues.
