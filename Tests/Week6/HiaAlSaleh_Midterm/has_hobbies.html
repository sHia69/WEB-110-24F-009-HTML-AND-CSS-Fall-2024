            <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
            <p class="hobbies-section"> I really like Discord-it's basically the
                favorite place to connect and chill in. If I am not coding or
                working on my art, you can usually find me in the background
                playing Geometry Dash, osu! catch, chess, Roblox, Heart of
                Tibet, Giza, or Danganronpa V3. I've played Geometry Dash since
                2015, and it's still one of my favorite games.</p>
            <p class="hobbies-section">Outside gaming, I enjoy tinkering with
                projects and learning new things. Delving into technology-based
                ideas and learning new skills is very enjoyable. Mathematics,
                art, and especially <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/"
                    class="latex-link"><ruby>LaTeX<rt>La-TEX</rt></ruby></a> are
                quite interesting to me. LaTeX helps me format my works; it's
                clean and professional. I wrote my first <a
                    href="Mathematical_Analysis_of_a_Triple_Integral_using_Gamma_Function_and_Binomial_Series.pdf">research
                    paper</a> on mathematical analysis of a triple integral
                using gamma function and binomial series, formatted in LaTeX. I
                code, create art, or level up to achieve something meaningful
                which I share with others.</p>
            <p class="hobbies-section">I enjoy reading books, listening to
                music. I like to watch movies and Kdrama in my free time. I
                enjoy watching mystery, thriller, and horror movies. I like to
                read mystery, thriller, and horror books. I also enjoy reading
                about mathematics and computer science. I listen to a variety of
                music genres, including pop, rock, and classical.</p>
