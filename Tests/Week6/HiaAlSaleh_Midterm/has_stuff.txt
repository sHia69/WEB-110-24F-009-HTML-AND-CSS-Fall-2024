About Me
Hello, my name is Hia, but its actual pronunciation is Haya. You could have wondered, how did it change to Hia; it is because I was in Germany, and they didn't have this name. 
So, you can see that it is Hia, but my preference is Haya because it is my real one. My pronouns are she/her. I speak three fluent languages: Turkmen, Arabic, and Turkish. 
I have learned English in Canada, and I can speak four languages. I am also learning Korean and Spanish.

I live in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In my family, there are three sisters and one brother. 
Since my family had always made me the middle child, I would find a balance in or between my siblings. Currently, I am attending St. Clair College as a first-year Computer Programming student. It all started in high school, really, where I learned tons about different coding languages, various tools, and generally about tech stuff. I really like coding because it offers challenges while building something new. My goal is to be continuously better and work on software that may do some real good. 
I would be glad to share more about my interests and experiences with you!

I made an additional personal website, but it does not have my real name on it. You can check it out here: MyWebsite.

Additional Information

Why did you choose the Computer Programming program at St. Clair College?
I choose this program because I like programming.

If you could meet one person on this planet, who would it be and why!
If I could meet one person on this planet, I would choose to meet the famous mathematician, Andrew Wiles. He is known for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that had remained unsolved for over 350 years. I would love to discuss his journey and the challenges he faced while working on this theorem.

My Hobbies 

I really like Discord—it's basically my favorite place to connect and chill. If I’m not coding or working on my art, you can usually find me playing Geometry Dash, osu!catch, chess, Roblox, Heart of Tibet, Giza, or Danganronpa V3. I’ve played Geometry Dash since 2015, and it's still one of my favorite games.

Outside gaming, I enjoy tinkering with projects and learning new things. Delving into technology-based ideas and learning new skills is very enjoyable. Mathematics, art, and especially LaTeX are quite interesting to me. LaTeX helps me format my works; it's clean and professional. I wrote my first research paper on the mathematical analysis of a triple integral using gamma function and binomial series, formatted in LaTeX. I code, create art, or level up to achieve something meaningful to share with others.

I enjoy reading books, listening to music, and watching movies and Kdramas in my free time. I enjoy mystery, thriller, and horror movies, as well as reading about mathematics and computer science. I also listen to a variety of music genres, including pop, rock, and classical.
